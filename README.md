## Overview

This project provides a decentralized solution for the authentication and provenance tracking of valuable musical instruments. It addresses common challenges in the rare instrument market such as:

- Verifying instrument authenticity
- Tracking ownership history
- Documenting condition and restoration
- Validating maker attribution

The system uses blockchain technology to create immutable records of instruments, their makers, ownership history, and condition assessments, providing a trustworthy source of truth for all stakeholders in the rare instrument ecosystem.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main smart contracts that work together:

![System Architecture](https://v0.dev/placeholder.svg?height=400&width=600)

### 1. Instrument Registry (`instrument-registry.clar`)

- Registers instruments with detailed information
- Tracks current ownership
- Enables secure ownership transfers
- Maintains a unique identifier for each instrument

### 2. Maker Verification (`maker-verification.clar`)

- Registers instrument makers/craftspeople
- Provides verification by authorized entities
- Links makers to their instruments
- Establishes trust in instrument attribution

### 3. Provenance (`provenance.clar`)

- Documents complete ownership history
- Records transaction details
- Creates an immutable chain of custody
- Enables verification of historical claims

### 4. Condition Assessment (`condition-assessment.clar`)

- Tracks instrument condition over time
- Records restoration history
- Requires authorized appraisers
- Provides objective condition ratings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Clarity-compatible blockchain environment (e.g., Stacks blockchain)
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for local development and testing
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts and Clarity language

### Installation
